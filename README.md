Calvary Med

Due to the COVID virus, NHS waiting lists are twice as long even though there are not shortages of patients who need basic healthcare not related to covid.
Many UK residents are looking for quicker appointment times without having to spend a fortune on private healthcare.

Calvary Medical Services is an intermediary service that provides quicker GP appointments for people in the UK. Users can use a map to search for doctors in their preferred areas and then contact us with this information to get 24hour appointments instead of joining the general NHS line which is often long and may take many weeks to months. 
The map will show various doctors in the selected town and the user can pick ones closest to them or their preferred doctor.

UX
This site is intended for anyone who lives in the UK and wants faster doctors appointments but do not want to pay the cost of private health care.
The website consists of four (4) parts:
	
* Navigation bar-  This first line of eye contact has our name _CALVARY body on the left and three (3) links namely - About us (scrolls to about us page), search (scrolls to search page) and help button (scrolls to contact us page at the bottom). When minimised or viewed with mobile, it collapses into a menu with a hamburger button.
* The About us page - This is the first section that the user sees. It explains what the site is about and what service is being offered. On same section, there is a button called Doctor search that takes you to the next section of the page. 
* The Search page - This section houses the map search function. This is where users can input any town in the UK, search and find doctors in the UK. Different locations will appear on the map and be displayed as pins in the results box 
* The contact us page - After users have searched for doctors in their town, the pop up modal enables users send us a message with details about the service they want.
