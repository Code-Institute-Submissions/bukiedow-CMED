Calvary Med

Due to the COVID virus, NHS waiting lists are twice as long even though there are not shortages of patients who need basic healthcare not related to covid.
Many UK residents are looking for quicker appointment times without having to spend a fortune on private healthcare.

Calvary Medical Services is an intermediary service that provides quicker GP appointments for people in the UK. Users can use a map to search for doctors in their preferred areas and then contact us with this information to get 24hour appointments instead of joining the general NHS line which is often long and may take many weeks to months. 
The map will show various doctors in the selected town and the user can pick ones closest to them or their preferred doctor.
